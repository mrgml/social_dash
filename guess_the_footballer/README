Guess the footballer

This is a prototype of a game that tests your knowledge of footballers.

It asks you for a username (to enable scorekeeping) and then takes you straight to guess your first biography.

That should be all you need to know to get started using it.



Technical stuff:
The testing is all done with cucumber and webrat.  There are stubs for rspec but they are as yet unimplemented.

The seeds.db has biography information for one footabller this was sufficient to prove the prototype and can be easily extended.
